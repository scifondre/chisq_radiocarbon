The Jupyter Notebook file main.ipynb consists in the complete and standalone code to perform one single iteration of the simulation described in the study.

The notebook can be run as many times as pleased. The results of each iteration will be automatically saved as an Excel .xlsx file in the folder './Data/Results/'.

The notebook montecarlo_analysis.ipynb imports all the results present in the aforementioned folder, averages them and creates overview plots (boxplots and heatmaps) as shown in the manuscript.

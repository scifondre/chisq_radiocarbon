The full graphic outputs of the simulation consists in:
-- Chi-Squared plots per simulation type (9 types) per century (19 centuries) per iterations of the simulation (40 itertations), 
   for a total of 6840 plots;
-- Another 6840 plots representing each simulated dataset together with the overlapping portion of IntCal20;
-- 2 boxplots and 3 heatmaps per each of the 40 iterations, for a total of 200 plots, as an overview of the results of each iteration.

Because of the elevated number of files and the heavy space requirements, all these plots can be accessed through a repository on MEGA:

As of May 22nd 2024, I am still in the process of uploading all the files in that repository. I plan to finish this process in a few days time.

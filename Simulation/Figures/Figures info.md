The full graphic outputs of the simulation consists in:<br>
-- Chi-Squared plots per simulation type (9 types) per century (19 centuries) per iterations of the simulation (40 itertations), 
   for a total of 6840 plots;<br>
-- Another 6840 plots representing each simulated dataset together with the overlapping portion of IntCal20;<br>
-- 2 boxplots and 3 heatmaps per each of the 40 iterations, for a total of 200 plots, as an overview of the results of each iteration.<br>
<br>
Because of the elevated number of files and the heavy space requirements, all these plots can be accessed through a repository on MEGA:<br>

As of May 22nd 2024, I am still in the process of uploading all the files in that repository. I plan to finish this process in a few days time.
